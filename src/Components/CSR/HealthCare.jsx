                    Deeply ingrained in Nationalâ€™s philosophy is the belief in giving back to society and contributing to building a stronger community. For the past 5 years, in loving memory of Late Sri Vinodrai Vrajlal Parekh, we have organized Eye Camps. These Eye Camps last for a month and provide free eye checkups, cataract surgery, including eye glasses, and post-operative eye care for all those in need. </p>
